# LSTM-Autoencoder

## convolutional-auto-encoder.ipynb

### What it Does
Trains and tests a map Encoder and Decoder using generated map data.



## LSTM_w_Encoder.ipynb

### What it Does
Trains and tests a LSTM that takes a current point, goal point, and encoded map as input. This LSTM can only be trained with path data from one map.



## example_output.ipynb

### What it Does
Loads a trained LSTM and map Encoder to display example output.



## LSTM_diff_maps.ipynb

### What it Does
Trains and tests a LSTM that takes a current point, goal point, and encoded map as input. This LSTM can be trained with path data from multiple maps.
